## Research Gap Identified

**Current work has done:**
- Single-platform sentiment analysis
- Ensemble methods (simple averaging/voting)
- YouTube analysis in isolation

**No one has:**
- Combined cross-platform divergence with meta-learning for credibility detection
- Used sentiment disagreement as misinformation signal
- Built context-aware ensemble that learns when to trust each model

**Our contribution:**
This is the gap we fill.
