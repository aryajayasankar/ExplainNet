## 🎯 Research Plan Summary

### Research Question
**"Does sentiment divergence between YouTube videos and news articles predict content credibility issues?"**

### Novel Contributions
1. **Context-aware meta-learner** that learns when to trust each sentiment model
2. **Sentiment Divergence Score (SDS)** for cross-platform credibility assessment
3. **125-video annotated dataset** (publicly released)
4. **Comprehensive evaluation** with statistical significance testing

### Timeline
- **Month 1 (Dec)**: Dataset creation (125 videos annotated)
- **Month 2 (Jan)**: Novel methodology (meta-learner + divergence metric)
- **Month 3 (Feb)**: Writing & submission (PeerJ Computer Science)

### Target Journal
**PeerJ Computer Science**
- Free to publish ($0)
- 45% acceptance rate
- 6-10 week review time
- Legitimate, indexed, respectable

## 🚀 Your First Steps (THIS WEEK)

### Day 1 (Today)
1. Read `QUICK_START.md`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r Journal\scripts\requirements_research.txt`
3. Run: `python Journal\scripts\01_topic_selection.py`

### Day 2-3
1. Read `ANNOTATION_GUIDELINES.md` thoroughly
2. Test data collection on 2 topics (edit script to limit)
3. Verify pipeline works

### Day 4-7
1. Run full data collection (all 25 topics, ~8 hours)
2. Practice annotating 10 videos
3. Calculate your annotation speed

### End of Week 1
You should have:
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ 125 videos collected
- ✅ Comfortable with annotation process
- ✅ Clear understanding of timeline

## 🎓 What You'll Learn

1. **Research methodology**: Hypothesis testing, statistical analysis
2. **Machine learning**: Meta-learning, ensemble methods, cross-validation
3. **NLP**: Sentiment analysis, transformer models
4. **Academic writing**: Paper structure, literature review
5. **Reproducible research**: Code release, dataset documentation

## 📈 Expected Outcome

**Best case (40% probability)**:
- Paper accepted in PeerJ (May 2026)
- Published, citable work
- Public dataset with DOI
- Strong addition to CV/portfolio

**Realistic case (50% probability)**:
- Major revisions required
- Resubmit and eventual acceptance (July 2026)
- Still publishable, just delayed

**Worst case (10% probability)**:
- Rejected from PeerJ
- Submit to backup journal (SoftwareX)
- Eventually published somewhere

**Even if worst case**: You have a complete research project, dataset, and paper draft. That's valuable.

## 🔥 Motivation

You're building something real:
- A novel method (meta-learner)
- A public dataset (125 videos)
- A research contribution (divergence metric)
- A published paper (hopefully)

This isn't just a school project. This is **actual research** that could be cited by others.

**Stay focused. Stay consistent. You got this.** 💪
